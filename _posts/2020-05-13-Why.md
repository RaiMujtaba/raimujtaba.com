Since last few days a word is stuck in my mind which is "WHY?".

Life is not just a random play which we are supposed to navigate through at our own will or without any vision. 
Everything we do must have a reason behind it. Start from waking up everyday till going back to sleep every step we take,
every work we are planning to do we should be very clear on our "WHY" for that thing. 

Lets take an example of eating, can there be any WHY behind our act of eating? Yes, in my opinion we eat because it keeps
us upright, you might be thinking this is a silly example. But if you think little more actually we forget our WHY 
behind eating that is why we have so much junk food around.
 
Problem of modern times is that most people forget their WHY. They are just doing stuff for the sake of doing it. Scrolling 
social media for hours and hours without any purpose of doing it. Talking about news which barely concerns them and watching 
Netflix for the sake of gaining nothing. I am now planning to access my every action under the question of WHY before taking 
first step of doing it. 

I didn't meant that whatever we do is wrong rather what my point is that we should know our WHY behind every action of ours. Thanks.
